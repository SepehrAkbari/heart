Hi,

This project got very interesting to me, so I tried a lot of different models and approaches to improve the performance. A lot of this is outside the scope of the original project, but I would not say they are irrelevant. The notebook mentions which sections to look at for the core project (grading wise), and the report is longer walking through all the experiments I did, but not in a great amount of detail. More technical details are in the notebook about every single model.

I hope you find this interesting :)

Here is the full GitHub repo to explore even further: [https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/heart](https://github.com/SepehrAkbari/heart). All the figures, code, models, and data are found there.
