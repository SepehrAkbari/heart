## Data

This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the heart disease prediction models. The original data is sourced from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/1.0.0/), in their *Classification of Heart Sound Recordings: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016*.

The directories, [processed](./processed/) and [splits](./splits/) are not included in the original data, and are outcomes of our preprocessing steps. The [processed](./processed/) directory holds the images used to train, validate, and test our models along with labels, and [splits](./splits/) contain CVS files of our train, validation, and test datasets.
